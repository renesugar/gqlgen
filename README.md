## What is gqlgen?

[gqlgen](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen) is a Go library for building GraphQL servers without any fuss. gqlgen is:

 - **Schema first** — Define your API using the GraphQL [Schema Definition Language](http://graphql.org/learn/schema/).
 - **Type safe** — You should never see `map[string]interface{}` here.
 - **Codegen** — Let us generate the boring bits, so you can build your app quickly.
